Data preprocessing:
Data Cleaning : vaccuu, valid(outlier,occ is positive), accurate(birthday as 1st-Jan, data skewed bcoz of correctness),complete(missing),consistent,unique,uniform  
Data wrangling 
EDA-
Univariate Analysis:descriptive measures of centrality,spead,skewness, 
Bivariate Analysis:statistical tests
